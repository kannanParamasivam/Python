## Zen of Python
* ### Flat is better than nested
```Python
a = 'kannan'
if a == 'kannan':
    print('a is kannan')
else:
    if a == 'Raksith':
        print('a is Raksith')
```
Following is better than above
```python
a = 'kannan'
if a == 'kannan':
    print('a is kannan')
elif a == 'Raksith'::
    print('a is Raksith')
```

* ### Explicit is better than implicit
```python
ctr = 5
while ctr != 0:
    print(ctr)
    ctr -= 1
```
Above is better than following
```python
ctr = 5
while ctr
    print(ctr)
    ctr -= 1
```
